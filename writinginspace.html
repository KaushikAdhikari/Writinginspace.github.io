        <h2>A Zero Gravity Pen that can be used in space: "Fisher Space Pen"</h2>
<p>
    A common misconception states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, the Fisher Space Pen was devised as the result of millions of dollars of unnecessary spending on NASA's part when the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils, making the pen an example of overengineering.;.

        <h2>In reality,</h2>
<p>
    The space pen was independently developed by Paul C. Fisher, founder of the Fisher Pen Company, with $1 million of his own funds.[2][3][4] NASA tested and approved the pen for space use, especially since they were less flammable than pencils,[1] then purchased 400 pens at $6 per pen.[5] The Soviet Union subsequently also purchased the space pen for its Soyuz spaceflights.;.
